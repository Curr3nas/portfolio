      <h1>Hello! My name is Douglas, and I am an aspiring full stack developer.</h1>
      <p>
        I am currently a Web Development student in Thinkful's Software Engineering Immersion program. I love coding because I enjoy the rush of being able to solve puzzles and everything about code, for me, is just solving a puzzle! I am particularly fond of making the functionality of a site work smoothly and seamlessly.
      </p>
      <p>
        I first became interested in web development when I was put in charge of maintaining the used motorcycle inventory page of the Harley-Davidson dealership where I used to work. I decided to follow through on that interest when I realized that I could make a better website for my church.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I am not working on an app or a site, then I am usually gaming. I also serve at my Church and am a voracious reader. My current pursuits include getting my CompTIA A+ certification and learning how to speak Chinese.

        <h3>Quiz App</h3>
        <img src="quizappcompressed.png" alt="Screenshot of the Quiz App">
        <p>
          This was my first coding project. It is a general trivia quiz that takes the user through a series of questions, providing feedback, and tracking progress and score throughout the quiz. It uses responsive design and takes advantage of the React-ful design pattern to keep the DOM uncluttered and the page loading quickly.

        <p>
          This app was built with a partner.Our Spaced Repetition app allows users to build their vocabulary in new languages. Using the linked list data structure, our app efficiently tests users knowledge. Words that are guessed incorrectly are presented more frequently. Users can see their total score and a dashboard with statistics for each word in the language.

          This project was created in a team of six. I was given the role of Project Manager. We used the Google Maps API and the Google Places API to create a fun travel app that would allow you to pick personal interests and be presented with options to stop at on the way to your destination.
